I would walk while others stop; I would awake while others sleep, and I would listen when others talk, and how I would enjoy a good chocolate ice cream!\n我会少睡觉，多思考。因为我知道，每当我们闭上一分钟眼睛，我们也就同时失去了60秒。当他人停滞时我会前行，当他人入梦时我会清醒，当他人讲话时我会倾听，就像享受一支美味的巧克力冰激凌！\nIf God would give me a little bit more of life, I would dress in a simple manner, I would place myself in front of the sun, leaving not only my body, but my soul naked.\n如果上帝赏我一段生命，我会简单装束，伏在阳光下，袒露的不仅是身体，还有我的魂灵。\nMy God, if I had a heart, I would write my hatred on ice and wait for the sun to come out. With a dream of Van Gogh I would paint on the stars a poem by Benedetti, and a song by Serrat would be my serenade to the moon. With my tears I would water the roses, to feel the pain of their thorns and the incarnated kiss of their petals … My God, if I only had a scrap of life.\n上帝呀，如果我有一颗心，我会将仇恨写在冰上，然后期待太阳的升起；我会用凡高的梦在星星上画一首贝内德第的诗，而塞莱特的歌将是我献给月亮的小夜曲。我会用泪水浇灌玫瑰，以此体味花刺的痛苦和花瓣的亲吻……上帝呀，如果我有一段生命……\nI wouldn’t let a single day pass without telling the people I love that I love them. I would convince each woman and each man that they are my favorites, and I would live in love with love.\n我不会放过哪怕是一天，而不对我所爱的人说我爱他们。我会使每个男人和女人都了解他们皆我所爱，我要怀着爱而生活。\nTo all, I would say how mistaken they are when they think that they stop falling in love when they grow old, without knowing that they grow old when they stop falling in love.\n对于大人，我会向他们证明，那种认为因衰老而失去爱的想法是多么错误，我们是因为失去爱而衰老而不是与之相反。\nI would give wings to children, but I would leave it to them to learn how to fly by themselves.\n对于孩子，我会给他们插上翅膀而让他们自己学会飞翔；\nTo old people I would say that death doesn’t arrive when they grow old, but with forgetfulness.\n对于老人，我会教给他们死亡的来临不是因为衰老而是因为遗忘。\nI have learned so much with you all, I have learned that everybody wants to live on top of the mountain, without knowing that true happiness is obtained in the journey taken and the form used to reach the top of the hill.\n人呀，我从你们身上学会了太多的东西… …我知道，人们都想伫立在颠峰上，殊不知，真正的幸福恰恰就在于攀登险阻的过程。\nI have learned that when a newborn baby holds, with its little hand, his father’s finger, it has trapped him for the rest of his life.\n我懂得，当婴儿用小拳头第一次抓住爸爸的手指时，他也就永远地抓住了它。\nI have learned that a man has the right and obligation to look down at another man, only when that man needs help to get up from the ground.\n我明白，一个人只有在帮助他人站起时才有权利俯视他。\nFrom you I have learned so many things, but in truth they won’t be of much use, for when I keep them within this suitcase, unhappily shall I be dying.\n我能够从你们身上学到的东西是如此之多，可事实上已经意义寥寥，因为当人们将我敛入棺木时，我正在死去。\nSay always what you feel, not what you think.\n永远说你感到的，做你想到的吧！\nIf I knew that today is the last time that I am going to see you asleep, I would hug you with all my strength and I would pray to the Lord to let me be the guardian angel of your soul.\n如果我知道今天是我最后一次看你入睡，我会热烈地拥抱你，祈求上帝守护你的灵魂。\nIf I knew that this is the last time I’m going to see you leave the house, I would hug you and kiss you, then I would call you, I would hug you and kiss you again.\n如果我知道这是最后一次看你离开家门，我会给你一个拥抱一个吻，然后重新叫住你，再度拥抱亲吻。\nIf I knew that this is the last time to hear your voice, I would record each word and each sentence of you, so that I could listen to it over and over again.\n如果我知道这是最后一次听到你的声音，我会录下你的每个字句，以便可以一遍又一遍永无穷尽地倾听。\nIf I knew that these are the last moments to see you, I would say “I love you” instead of silly to think that you already knew.\n如果我知道这是看到你的最后几分钟，我会说\"我爱你\"，而不是傻傻地以为你早已知道。\nThere is always tomorrow, and life gives us another opportunity to do things right, but in case I am wrong, and today is all that is left to me, I would love to tell you how much I love you and that I will never forget you.\n永远有一个明天，生活给我们另一个机会将事情做好，可是如果我搞错了，今天就是我们所剩的全部，我会对你说我多么爱你，我永远不会忘记你。\nTomorrow is never guaranteed to anyone, young or old. Today could be the last time to see your loved ones, which is why you mustn’t wait; do it today, in case tomorrow never arrives. I am sure you will be sorry you wasted the opportunity today to give a smile, a hug, a kiss, and that you were too busy to grant them their last wish.\n明天从不向任何人作保证，无论青年或老人，今天可能就是你最后一次看到你所爱的人。因此，别再等待了，今天就开始！因为如果明天永远不来，你也许会遗憾今天没来得及微笑，拥抱，亲吻，会遗憾自己忙碌得只能把它们归为一个最后的愿望。\nKeep your loved ones near you; tell them in their ears and to their faces how much you need them and love them. Love them and treat them well; take your time to tell them “I am sorry”; “forgive me”, “please”, “thank you”, and all those loving words you know!\n保护周围你爱的人吧，告诉他们你多么需要他们。爱他们，善待他们，用些时间对他们说：“对不起”，“原谅我”，“劳驾”，“谢谢”，以及你知道的所有爱的话语。\nNobody will know you for your secret thought. Ask the Lord for wisdom and strength to express them. Show your friends and loved ones how important they are to you.\n没有人会因为你秘而不宣的思想而记住你。向上帝祈求力量和智慧来表达它们吧，向你的朋友证明，他们对你来说是多么的重要。\nFor you, With much love,\n写给你们，带着我无尽的爱\nYour Friend,\n你们的朋友\nGabriel Garcia Marquez\n","wordCount":"857","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/images/papermod-cover.png","datePublished":"2022-04-05T00:17:28+08:00","dateModified":"2022-04-05T00:17:28+08:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Theme PaperMod"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/post/%E5%A6%82%E6%9E%9C%E6%88%91%E6%9C%89%E4%B8%80%E6%AE%B5%E7%94%9F%E5%91%BD/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"PaperMod","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/ accesskey=h title="PaperMod (Alt + H)">PaperMod</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li><li><a href=https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/fr/ title=French aria-label=:fr:>🇫🇷</a></li><li><a href=https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/fa/ title=Fa aria-label=Fa>Fa</a></li></ul></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/archives title=Archive><span>Archive</span></a></li><li><a href=https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/search/ title=Search><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/wiki/ title=WiKi><span>WiKi</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://adityatelange.github.io/hugo-PaperMod/post/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">如果我有一段生命</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-04-05 00:17:28 +0800 +0800'>April 5, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;5 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;Theme PaperMod&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod/tree/exampleSite/content/post/%e5%a6%82%e6%9e%9c%e6%88%91%e6%9c%89%e4%b8%80%e6%ae%b5%e7%94%9f%e5%91%bd.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=post-content><p>If God, for a second, forgot what I have become and granted me a little bit more of life, I would use it to the best of my ability.</p><p>如果有一刹那，上帝忘记我是一只布偶并赋予我片刻生命，我会最大限度的利用起来。</p><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t possibly, say everything that is in my mind, but I would be more thoughtful of all I say…</p><p>我可能不会说出我心中的一切所想，但我必定会思考我所说的一切。</p><p>I would give merit to things not for what they are worth, but for what they mean to express.</p><p>我会评价事物，按其意义大小而非价值多少。</p><p>I would sleep less, I would dream more, because I know that for every minute that we close our eyes, we waste 60 seconds of light.
