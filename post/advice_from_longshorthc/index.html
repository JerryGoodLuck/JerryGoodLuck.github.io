Shaw (not a pod)…\nCitadel/Aptigon and Schonfeld, over which time I hired/employed/trained a dozen or so analysts. (And then threw up two middle fingers and retired…more on that later). So I’m by no means the absolute authority on pods. But here is my advice:\n  You’re job is make your PM’s life easier. Full stop. Don’t forget this. Run through walls for PM. Let PM know this. Don’t whine and complain about your “career development” or comp in your first two years. Don’t do it. That era will come. Be a ride or die, and let PM know it\n  Use your “golden three months”. Life happens fast at pods. It has to - it’s sink or swim. However, you CAN be the naive newbie for 3 months. So ask questions!! Create a running list, ask PM for 10 min a week and ask anything you don’t understand. Don’t pretend like you do!!!\n  2 contd) Use more senior analysts on team as resource. But you have 3 months. By month 6 the naive newbie schtick will be old, and you will be expected to contribute. Sell side teach in calls can be helpful. Be a sponge. Be a sponge. Be a sponge.\n learn to communicate. Seasoned pod players have a distinct communication style. Terse. Direct. No BS. Tell me what I need to know and no more. They don’t have time to waste on 15 minute convos about your weekend. This isn’t I-banking. Mimic how Sr analysts speak to PM.\n  Zero defect mentality. This isn’t I-banking where you send a deck to associate, get 56 markups and turn the deck 6 more times. Don’t send anything to PM until it has been 5x checked and perfect. Fastest way to ruin reputation is to send sloppy work.\n  Study compliance procedures very carefully. Contrary to some beliefs, pod PMs are insanely careful about MNPI and don’t want to touch gray areas. Personal trading, consultant calls and mgmt meetings are focus areas. Make sure you don’t foot fault here. If you make a mistake…\n  5 contd) …that gets firm involved it will be very bad for you. You are easy to fire. Compliance and the GC are your friends and use them proactively (don’t assume you know the answer). Even if you can own individual stocks I would just own indexes first few years.\n become the “techie, data guy”. Learn all the risk model UI, excel pulls, Bloomberg bells and whistles, etc. There is a lot of this and PMs are older and less tech savvy. Become friends with the data science team and become your teams internal data guy. Add value like this.\n  FILO. First in, last out. Shouldn’t have to say this, but i do. It matters. Don’t take vacation your first year. Sounds harsh, but your first 12 months isn’t a career, it’s a try out. Treat it that way.\n  Find your voice. You don’t want to be the arrogant know it all, but you don’t want be the person who can’t take a stand.

  <div class="post-content"><p>Had a DM question asking for advice for a brand new analyst working at a pod shop. Noodled on it, and figured I would share the thoughts broadly in case helpful. I am far from the most tenured and successful pod PM - spent 4 years as a PM at combo of D.E. Shaw (not a pod)…</p>
<p>Citadel/Aptigon and Schonfeld, over which time I hired/employed/trained a dozen or so analysts. (And then threw up two middle fingers and retired…more on that later). So I’m by no means the absolute authority on pods. But here is my advice:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You’re job is make your PM’s life easier. Full stop. Don’t forget this. Run through walls for PM. Let PM know this. Don’t whine and complain about your “career development” or comp in your first two years. Don’t do it. That era will come. Be a ride or die, and let PM know it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use your “golden three months”.  Life happens fast at pods. It has to - it’s sink or swim. However, you CAN be the naive newbie for 3 months. So ask questions!! Create a running list, ask PM for 10
min a week and ask anything you don’t understand. Don’t pretend like you do!!!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>2 contd) Use more senior analysts on team as resource. But you have 3 months. By month 6 the naive newbie schtick will be old, and you will be expected to contribute. Sell side teach in calls can be helpful. Be a sponge. Be a sponge. Be a sponge.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>learn to communicate. Seasoned pod players have a distinct communication style. Terse. Direct. No BS. Tell me what I need to know and no more. They don’t have time to waste on 15 minute convos about your weekend. This isn’t I-banking. Mimic how Sr analysts speak to PM.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero defect mentality. This isn’t I-banking where you send a deck to associate, get 56 markups and turn the deck 6 more times. Don’t send anything to PM until it has been 5x checked and perfect. Fastest way to ruin reputation is to send sloppy work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study compliance procedures very carefully. Contrary to some beliefs, pod PMs are insanely careful about MNPI and don’t want to touch gray areas. Personal trading, consultant calls and mgmt meetings are focus areas. Make sure you don’t foot fault here. If you make a mistake…</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>5 contd) …that gets firm involved it will be very bad for you. You are easy to fire. Compliance and the GC are your friends and use them proactively (don’t assume you know the answer). Even if you can own individual stocks I would just own indexes first few years.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<p>become the “techie,
data guy”. Learn all the risk model UI, excel pulls, Bloomberg bells and whistles, etc. There is a lot of this and PMs are older and less tech savvy. Become friends with the data science team and become your teams internal data guy. Add value like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>FILO. First in, last out. Shouldn’t have to say this, but i do. It matters. Don’t take vacation your first year. Sounds harsh, but your first 12 months isn’t a career, it’s a try out. Treat it that way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Find your voice. You don’t want to be the arrogant know it all, but you don’t want be the person who can’t take a stand. Observe, listen more than you speak, contemplate, but when you have an opinion you must voice it. Use data, analogs, and facts to support, not opinion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>be a culture carrier. Make it about your team, not yourself. Be even keeled in drawdowns. Be yourself, tell jokes, do your best to be likeable. Obsessively identify ways to be helpful. Be a fixture at team happy hours, etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>know the game you chose, and embrace it. Pod life is fundamentally impermanent. You could make a million+ a year by year 3 or be fired in 3 months. You cannot be too attached for either outcome or you will drive yourself mad. Embrace the uncertainty. Some teams/seats last…</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>10 contd) …for years. But the pod GP’s are fundamentally PM traders who cut losers and let winers run. Given the leverage, it can’t be any other way. So ride the ride - highs will be euphoric and lows will be depressive. Thats life. In 3-5 years, you will have battle scars…</p>
<p>10 contd) …and tons of lessons learned (keep a trading journal), and if you do it right you will turn into a total badass money maker. But it’s a journey, and you won’t be there day 1. Best luck!</p>
